# EPEC
EventProducerEventConsumer

This is just our idea to built a unique method to communicate, from starting to a EMH design pattern.

The starting point is to not use Event State Machine instead of the Queue State Machine.

Why? 

User Dynamic Event is very useful is queued and it's N:N N:1 available.

Event structure have just timeout case.

In the ESM Folder you can found a template of ESM.
